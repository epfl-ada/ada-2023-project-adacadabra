# ada-2023-project-adacadabra
just added the preprocessing notebook to have the collaborator name 
## added collaborators_name_final : 
the functions implemented in the previous notebook final_collab have been applied to all the dataset
In this notebook, the task realized are:

1) First taks: functions that will help us find the collaborators IDs, and the dataset needed to find the IDS.
2) Second task: Importing the dataset and applying our functions to it.
3) Third task: Create a new dataframe with collaborators IDs per week (for a join with our other dataset)
